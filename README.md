## Features

- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Kubernetes deployment for easy scaling and management
- React Native frontend for cross-platform mobile support

## Architecture

This application is built using a microservices architecture:

- Frontend: React Native
- API Gateway: Node.js with Express
- Auth Service: Node.js with Express and MongoDB
- Task Service: Node.js with Express and MongoDB
- Database: MongoDB

All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (Minikube for local development)
- kubectl
- Skaffold

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app
Copy
2. Install dependencies for all services:
npm run install:all
Copy
3. Set up environment variables:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in each service directory
- Update the `.env` files with your configuration

## Running the Application

To start the application in development mode:
npm run start:dev
Copy
This command uses Skaffold to build and deploy the services to your local Kubernetes cluster.

Access the application:
- Frontend: Use the Expo client or connect to http://localhost:19000
- API: http://localhost:3000

## Testing

Run tests for all services:
npm test
Copy
To run tests for a specific service:
npm run test:frontend
npm run test:auth
npm run test:task
npm run test:gateway
Copy
## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production Kubernetes cluster:

1. Update the `skaffold.yaml` file with your production configuration
2. Run:
npm run deploy
Copy
## API Documentation

API documentation is available at `/api-docs` when running the application.
